The MadLibs app enables a user to generate a story, in which the user has filled in some gaps without knowing the context of these words. The app randomly chooses a story from a list of possible stories, and subsequently asks the user to fill in a number of words specific to that story. Finally, it shows the resulting story.

The app is built up from three different ViewControllers, each with a navigation controller on top. The first ViewController gives an introduction to the app, whereas the second enables the user to fill in the placeholders for the story. The app shows what kind of word needs to be filled in and how many words are still to be filled in; a user cannot leave a placeholder blank. Lastly, the third ViewController shows the final story with the placeholders filled in.
